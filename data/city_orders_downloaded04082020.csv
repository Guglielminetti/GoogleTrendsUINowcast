  Care Subsidy program will pay providers the full daily childcare rate for
  each child with an active certificate. Our providers can utilize these funds
  to stabilize operations during the extended closures and/or low attendance.
  The action also provides 30 days of financial relief for families in the
  subsidy program. Over 80% of current subsidy families have incomes below 250%
  of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Many of these families work in industries
  that were forced to close due to the pandemic and may no longer be able to
  afford the April daily family fees. Additionally, this action prevents
  families from withdrawing childcare enrollment, which would have a devastating
  effect on providers.
